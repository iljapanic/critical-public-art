	"abstract": "This paper reviews literature on public art. In the first part, it examines critical perspectives through a widely used categorization of public art as either large-scale reductionist projects or small-scale community-led initiatives. The paper then looks at methods for evaluating public art, followed by a discussion about the potential of public art to facilitate urban innovation.",
