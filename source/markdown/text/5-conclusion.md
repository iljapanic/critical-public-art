## Conclusion

This paper has first examined the critical perspectives and methods of public art as means of urban regeneration. It has then polemicized on the potential of public art to foster innovation and argued for the development of more inclusive community-oriented methods for production and procurement of public art. Here it seems appropriate to ask whether we are perhaps expecting too much from art? There is “widespread and uncritical acceptance, particularly among its commissioners, that putting art in the public realm is inherently a good thing” (Hall & Robertson, 2001, p. 18). However, public art is not a substitute for urban renewal or social workers. Its capacity to foster inclusion and innovation is mostly limited to symbolic, rather than material, needs of citizens (Sharp, Pollock, & Paddison, 2005). Therefore, when public art is being conceived, it is necessary to view it not in isolation, but as a tool and catalyst for social and political change in the broader context of other disciplines engaged in urban research.
